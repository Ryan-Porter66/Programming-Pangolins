# Payroll Management by Ryan Porter, Evan Slominski, Brooks Robison, Blake Humes

This is the final project for CSC 470 (Mr. Jenkins). This is a payroll management system. You can add employees/admins, delete them, edit them (including giving them deductions), edit the company information, and compile payroll (paystubs PDF and a NACHA file).

1. If any links do not work, contact Ryan Porter to get that corrected

   - This should work on Windows computers (10 or 11) 
   - This program will have race conditions, so ensure that 2 users do not do conflicting operations 
   - The computer must be in 12 hr. format (not 24 hr. format). This is a bug that is currently being worked on

   - This link should work for your DSU email.
   - This will contain the most up-to-date designs and documents, but those should be included in the zip file. However, the one thing that was too big for the zip file       was the recording of our voice-chat meetings. They are in the “Videos” folder.
