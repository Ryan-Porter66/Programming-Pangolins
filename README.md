# PayrollManagement by Ryan Porter, Evan Slominski, Brooks Robison, Blake Humes

This is the final project for CSC 470 (Mr. Jenkins). This is a payroll management system. You can add employees/admins, delete them, edit them (including giving them deductions), edit the company information, and compile payroll (paystubs PDF and a NACHA file).

  o	This will contain the most up-to-date designs and documents, but those should be included in the zip file. However, the one thing that was too big for the zip file       was the recording of our voice-chat meetings. They are in the “Videos” folder.
